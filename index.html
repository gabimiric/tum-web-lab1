  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I get along with just about anyone and avoid conflict at all costs.
    I can persevere through any challenges that may arise as long as I have a clear goal in mind.
    I have a pretty good understanding of languages like C++ and python.
    I despise Java.
    I am very familiar with the hardware level(specifications, pc building, maintenance, error troubleshooting)
